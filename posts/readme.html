<p>Hi world! A blog is something I've been meaning to do for a long time now. There's a lot of little things I've worked on that's hard to fit on something like a resume.</p>
<p>A lot of these are projects that may or may not be in an eternal state of progress and are an insight into what interests me and what I've been working on. I do think about each of these projects again from time to time - thinking about how I can progress them and grow them.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Some things that I've looked into recently are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse engineering</li>
<li>Creating visual art</li>
<li>UEFI</li>
<li>Vulnerability research</li>
<li>Video game cheats</li>
<li>Lasers</li>
<li>Film photography</li>
<li>Music production</li>
</ul>
<p>As I'm writing this, I realize that a list is not the best way to explain what interests me.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I love solving novel problems that may or may not have a clear cut or obvious solution. This blog will contain posts about creative problem solving in general, not just in cybersecurity.</p>
