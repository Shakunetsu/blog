        <h1>I made a blog</h1>
<p>This marks the start of my personal blog, I hope to use this as a place to share the things I'm working on, and I hope it can be a valuable resource to someone in the future.</p>
<p>I've always been interested in blogs, to me, they are one of the most interesting forms of content on the internet, they can range from pure entertainment to incredibly in-depth research on topics you wouldn't even begin to imagine. As someone who has learned computer science and programming almost entirely on their own, blogs have provided more value than I have found in many of my teachers.</p>
<p>At this point I feel I have something of my own to contribute. And beyond that, I feel ready to explain the things I am doing, and in a way that is (hopefully) understandable to others in a meaningful way.</p>
<h2>What will I share on here?</h2>
<p>I will mostly write about the things I work on day-to-day, for starters, how I made this blog. I also have another web-based project going privately that I'd like to share as I continue development. hopefully this will be more inspiration for me to cover more educational topics as opposed to only functional ones, as I feel it may be more worth doing if I can share.</p>
<p>Algorithms also interest me, so I plan to write about a few of those.</p>
<h2>What languages will be used here?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust (mainly)</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>C/C++/C#</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are those fancy code blocks?</h2>
<p>I'm glad you asked :)</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">let a_variable = &quot;They even have syntax highlighting&quot;;
println!(&quot;{}&quot;, a_variable);
</code></pre>
